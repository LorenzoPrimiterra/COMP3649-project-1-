# SUMMARY: A read file that tests some of the specific grammar.

    Needed tests:
     - If an operation occurs:
            - operations cannot begin or end lines. 
            - To the left or right of the operation there must be a valid symbol.
            - The grammar cannot have repeated operators.
            - Assignments CAN occur, etc. a = b
            - only valid operators are allowed based on the language requirements,

t2 = t1 + 1
t3 = a * 3
b = t2 – t3
t4 = b / 2
d = c + t5
